This repo is designed to help you study Saša Jurić's book: Elixir in Action. 

I used markdown to indicate the different sections:
# 1 Chapter Name
## 1.1 Major section
### 1.1.1 Minor section
#### Listings (code snippets) and Figures (often graphs or other images)
> *Asides*
These are grey and indented in the book.  

**Smaller named sections** These are bold, smaller font in the book

Here's how you use it:  

1. Clone the repo.
2. Under each heading in the markdown files, type in one or more sentences summarizing this section, figure, code snippet, etc.
3. Save and commit often!

This is designed to help reading comprehension and note-taking. Feel free to add any headers you think I missed.
